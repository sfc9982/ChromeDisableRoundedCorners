## Why we have this

Since https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/3176190, Chromium introduce rounded corner when in Windows >= 11, so does browsers based on Chromium, CEF and Electron Apps. We could disable it using `chrome://flags` at past, but no longer available due to test end.
